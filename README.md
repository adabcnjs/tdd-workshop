# TDD Workshop
Code katas for the TDD workshop.

## Requirements
- `node` installed

**Optional**
We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The following extensions may be useful as well:
- [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest)
- [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode)

## Installing dependencies
In order to install the dependencies, please execute `npm install`.

## Executing tests
Every time that you want to run your tests, execute `npm test`.

Alternatively you can execute `npm run test:watch` to keep Jest running in watch mode; this means that your tests will re-run whenever you make changes to your code files.

You can execute `npm run report` to see your tests' report in the browser.
